# Moview

This application, written in Python, allows users to create and manage a list of their previously watched movies, search/view details for almost any movie (i.e. the ratings, runtimes, genres, etc.), and get genre-based recommendations with every movie viewed in the program. This software also allows for separate user accounts, so that multiple users can have their own lists within the same program.
